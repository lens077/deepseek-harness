Workspace entity registry (`ctx.workspaceRegistry`) for the DeepSeek Harness: durable workspace records, stable workspace order, and a newest-first candidate session index stored through the domain data form. Consumers see the `Workspace` interface; the entity implementation stays package-private.

The entity/storage rationale lives in the [domain Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-24-domain-kv-storage-and-workspace.md); header-only bootstrap and GUI ordering live in the [Workspace UI product-flow Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-25-workspace-ui-product-flow.md).

## Shape

- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.create(path, title?)` — canonicalizes `path` via `fs.realpath`, rejects a nonexistent or non-directory path, creates at most one record per canonical path, and prepends a new record to durable workspace order. Repeated calls for that path return the existing workspace without changing its title; different paths may share a display title.
- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.get(id)` / `list()` / `resolveByPath(path)` — cache-served lookups. `list()` is synchronous and follows durable registry order; `resolveByPath` is async because it applies the same `realpath` canon and rejects a missing path rather than creating it.
- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.insertBefore(id, before?)` — moves a registered Workspace within durable registry order, DOM-insertBefore-like: before the anchor, or appended when the anchor is omitted. A source or anchor absent from the registry rejects without writing; a self-anchor or move to the current position resolves without writing. The returned id list is the complete committed order.
- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.delete(id)` — removes only the Workspace registration, its durable order entry, and its session account. Unknown ids return `false`; a removed record returns `true`. The directory, user files, live Sessions, and persisted session logs are never touched, so those Sessions become Ungrouped. A table-write failure restores the prior order and published entity.
- `Workspace.attachSession(id)` and `attachSessions(ids)` validate live or persisted Session header cwd values against the Workspace path before writing, then prepend new ids in selection order. Unknown Sessions, absent/unresolvable/non-directory cwd values, and mismatches reject the complete call without writing. `detachSession` and `detachSessions` remove only Workspace accounting, prune invalid nested placement, and promote surviving children whose parent was removed.
- `Workspace.insertSessionBefore(id, before?)` — moves an accounted session within the manual order, DOM-insertBefore-like: before the anchor, or appended when the anchor is omitted. A session or anchor absent from the account rejects without writing; a move to the current position resolves without writing. Registry Workspace order never changes.
- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.archiveSession(id)` / `archiveSessions(ids)` / `unarchiveSession(id)` / `archivedSessionIds` — the registry-global archive set, layered over Workspace accounting: an archived Session disappears from active grouping surfaces but keeps its Session log and its `sessionIds` slot, so unarchiving restores the same position. Archiving accepts any live or persisted Session (accounted or Ungrouped), resolves without writing for an already archived id, and rejects an unknown id; batch archive validates every id before one state write. Unarchiving removes an archived id and resolves without writing when the id is absent, including an unknown id, so a stale archive entry remains recoverable. Both mutations serialize with registry operations and preserve the set's Host order. State written before the field existed parses with an empty set.
- `Workspace.sessionIds` — synchronous id-plus-canonical-cwd membership projection in durable candidate order. Missing headers, invalid cwd values, and mismatches are filtered; the next workspace mutation prunes them. A medium indexing one session under two workspaces, claiming one path from two records, or diverging from durable workspace order rejects at startup.
- `Workspace.status()` — uncached directory check, `'ok' | 'missing-dir'`; a missing directory never mutates the record.
- `ctx.workspaceRegistry.deleteSession(id, retire?)` computes the complete persisted descendant lineage, rejects unsafe live targets before mutation, writes a recoverable child-first deletion marker, removes every persistence artifact, then clears Workspace accounting, archive membership, and nested placement. The optional `RetireSessionsForDelete` callback is the ApiProxy-owned capability for retiring only its exact idle Agent handles; absent or insufficient ownership rejects live deletion.

`storageDomain` and `sessionPersistence` are required startup dependencies. An unavailable peer leaves the plugin pending and cannot commit an empty initialized marker. On the first successful start, the registry calls `SessionPersistence.list()` and uses only header `id`, `cwd`, and `createdAt` to group valid historical directories and persist initial order; it never reads event bodies. The initialized marker is written last, so partial bootstrap writes are reused safely after restart. Later cwd-only sessions remain Ungrouped.

Create and delete persist an explicit pending-mutation marker before their record and order can diverge. Startup completes only the marked mutation, then clears the marker; an unmarked order/table mismatch remains unexplained corruption and fails loud. Deleting and re-registering the same path creates a fresh Workspace id and does not automatically re-adopt the retained Sessions.

## Model Experience

### Workspace records and session accounts

#### What the model sees

Nothing. `ctx.workspaceRegistry` serves workspace records to host-side consumers only: the package registers no tools, injects no prompts, and writes no session events, so no request field ever carries this package's data.

#### Token effect

Zero direct tokens on every request.

#### KV Cache effect

Independent of live requests: the package never touches a request prefix, so it cannot invalidate provider cache reuse.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Destructive folder removal remains absent; Workspace registration deletion never substitutes for permanent Session deletion ([decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-27-workspace-registration-deletion.md)).
- The header index refreshes at startup and when attach must resolve an uncached persisted id; deletion or cwd damage performed by another process is observed after the next refresh or restart.
