English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package renders the deliverables row a finished turn ends with — the files the mutation tools created or modified — and links matching inline-code references in the closing prose, so a mentioned file opens in the Host. The vocabulary comes from the mutation tools' own `locations`, never from the closing prose — a produced file is listed whether or not the model remembered to name it. The shipped Web patch is the only composition that loads this package; removing its cordis.yml entry removes the guidance, row, and prose links together.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside `ui-conversation`; a finished turn then ends with the produced-files row between the closing message's body and its action footer. When `ui-session-files` supplies recorded hunks, a chip expands an inline before/after comparison and the expanded panel provides a separate Host opener; a chip without recorded hunks opens the file directly. Relative paths resolve against the Session cwd. When the row first appears, it queries `session.canOpenWorkspacePath()`, and an omitted-file **Show in folder** action opens the Session Workspace only when the page is loopback and that query succeeds with `true`.

### The row

The row uses CSS container-width bands to show a responsive prefix of up to six file chips. Flexbox shrinks and ellipsizes basename text, while CSS selects the matching localized `+ N files` label for omitted paths; the full path remains available as the title, and the chip lane performs no JavaScript layout observation or horizontal scrolling. The shared `all` / `single` / `none` preference opens every comparable file, only a one-file Turn, or none. A create stays closed because it has no prior side to compare.

### Inline-code links

The closing prose carries the same vocabulary: an inline-code token resolves by exact path, or by being exactly the basename of exactly one produced path — a basename two paths share stays inert rather than guessing, so a mention can never open the wrong file. A resolved mention keeps its code chip and takes the markdown sheet's link language, with the full path as its title.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The Node half registers the static `ui:deliverable-file-references` system-prompt section asking the model to mention primary files from successful creation or modification calls and to write those and any other changed-file references as Markdown inline code. The browser half registers `ProducedFiles` into the Chat view's `conversation.chat.turnTail` hole. `deliverablesDefinition` folds each Turn's successful first-party mutation calls into `DeliverablesTurnData` from the validated raw arguments of `write`, `edit`, and mutating `str_replace_editor` commands. Reads, deletes, unsupported tools, malformed calls, and failed results contribute nothing. A new mutation tool needs an explicit Client contribution before it joins the list. The package resolves the optional `chatFileDiffs` service lazily for each Session and also provides the `chatFileMentions` service the Chat view consults per closing message; composing the plugin out removes both deliverables surfaces and leaves the view's empty chain at zero cost.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the deliverables surface is not enough. They move from the row to the turn-tail hole and the decisions behind the vocabulary.

- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the `conversation.chat.turnTail` hole and renders the closing prose.
- [Workspace file links](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-31-web-workspace-file-links.md) — the decision behind the produced-files row and the Host open path.
- [Inline file mentions](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-07-web-inline-file-mentions.md) — the decision behind clickable mentions in the closing prose.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

### Clickable file-reference guidance

#### What the model sees

One fixed paragraph instructs the model to name primary files from successful creation or modification calls in its final response and to format those and any other changed-file references as exact-path or unique-basename Markdown inline code, such as `out/report.html`.

#### Token effect

One fixed prompt paragraph whenever this package is loaded; no tool schema, tool result, or per-Turn context is added.

#### KV Cache effect

The section is static at first-party order 9000 for the lifetime of the package mount, so it remains in the reusable prompt prefix and does not change across Turns.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current deliverables vocabulary. They are current package constraints, not a general file-linking comparison or a task backlog.

- **Mention matching is exact path or unique basename only** — a suffix mention stays inert; widening the matcher is deferred until a real closing-message shape needs it.
- **Files created indirectly by terminal commands remain outside the matching vocabulary** — naming such a file in inline code does not make it clickable unless a successful mutation location also records that path.
- **Native folder handoff targets the Host desktop** — a browser reached through a non-loopback authority omits the action, as does a deployment reporting no native opener; SSH forwarding that makes a remote Host look loopback-local must set the Session Controller's `nativeOpen: false`.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The prompt section, slot, dictionary, event definition, and optional service registrations are effect-owned with disposal proven by their plugin specs; this package owns no mutable state.
